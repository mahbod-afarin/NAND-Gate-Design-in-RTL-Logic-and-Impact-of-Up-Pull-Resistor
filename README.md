## Task 1: NAND Gate Design in RTL Logic and Impact of Up-Pull Resistor

- First, using the **Encounter_IC** tool, design a **NAND gate** in RTL logic and verify its functionality.
- Then, apply necessary changes to examine the impact of an **Up-Pull resistor** on:
  - Output loading
  - Induced delay
  - Functional correctness
- Clearly explain the reason behind each observed effect.

## Task 2: XOR Gate Design Using Different Logic Styles

Design a 2-input **XOR (Exclusive-OR)** function using the following technologies:

- **Pseudo-NMOS**
- **DCVSL (Differential Cascode Voltage Switch Logic)**
- **Dual-Rail Domino Logic**

For each technology:

- Explain its operational theory.
- Demonstrate functional correctness using the **Encounter_IC** tool.
